This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	DRINKS#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
This place ... god where do i begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Great Hot Dogs !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .	FOOD#PRICES#-1
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .

Maitre-D- '' Eat and get out ''	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .	DRINKS#QUALITY#1
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
A word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Best meal in a long time !	FOOD#QUALITY#1

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level	FOOD#QUALITY#1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#1

Don ’ t go to this place !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The food is very good , but not outstanding .	FOOD#QUALITY#0
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can I help you '' and `` how many are in your party . ''	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

The design of the space is good .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
But the service is HORRID !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
