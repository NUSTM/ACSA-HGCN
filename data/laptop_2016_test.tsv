Everything at a very great price .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1

Excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a Macbook .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
You ca n't get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Plus you get 500GB which is also a great feature .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Also , the resale value on this will keep .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I highly recommend you get one before they are gone .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Got this on black friday with a very good discount and could n't be happier .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The screen is great , I do n't see the need for a retina display .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
I also really like the addition of the SD Card slot .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
This Macbook Pro is AMAZING !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
If you are afraid of it not having a disc player please do n't be .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
I love the new high retina display , and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Overall , this is a fast , light , practical computer and I highly recommend it .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I bought my Macbook Pro in October of 2012 and 2 years later it still works as flawless as ever !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I 've never had any problems with the computer itself ( The Macbook charger chords are another story , though ) .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	POWER_SUPPLY#GENERAL#-1
I tried not to jump on the Apple bandwagon , but ... you 're just living in denial if you do n't .	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
Happy buying !	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
Bought this laptop from best buy in January 2015.. still loving it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I can use it as a tablet , as a laptop , as whatever I want to !	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I play Sims 4 and 3 on it all the time , with very little issues .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
The thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Music/videos sound great and look great .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#1	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
I use it everyday .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
My favorite computer I 've ever had !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This computer overall is great !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
it runs fast !	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
ships fast !	SHIPPING#QUALITY#1
etc . but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck !	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
I bought this pc to play games and stream movies ! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd !	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I could see the disk drive on the side but it did n't seem to have a button on it ?	OPTICAL_DRIVES#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
A DISK DRIVE WITH BUTTONS ON IT ! ! ! ! ! !	OPTICAL_DRIVES#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
And he said & quot ; this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious !	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
So beware buyer , this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
Thank you asus . ( they do n't deserve to be capitalized )	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
Great computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Very great Apple product as expected .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
Good battery life .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Great color on screen .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
Good speakers from laptop computer .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL#1
My new laptop is great .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
I have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but I like it .	OS#USABILITY#0	OS#GENERAL#1
I would recommend it to anyone .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
The speakers are fairly basic , so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL#0	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
The touchpad is a little & quot ; clunky & quot ; for my taste ; I use a small external mouse with laptops in any event .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I appreciate the relatively large keyboard ( with number pad ) and screen size .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled & quot ; pinch zoom. & quot ;	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
This is larger laptop , but is not too heavy .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Battery life is great - though it is new .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Overall , a solid laptop for its price .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#PRICE#0
However , a few things are immediately occurring to me I had read the other reviews here on amazon , but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Well , my first impressions are that its OK , it certainly boots up quickly ( thanks SSD ! ) , and from the limited use so far ( no games ) its fast enough in normal usage .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#0	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	HARD_DISC#GENERAL#1
It certainly looks nice , but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use ( could be I am pressing too hard perhaps ) , and the screen is well underwhelming .	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1	DISPLAY#GENERAL#-1
To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
This is a horrible laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Within a day of usage , it already slowed down significantly , virus entered the system right away .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
It 's heavy .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I regretted immediately .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Nothing like the description says .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
My Apple mac book pro has crashed three times , since I purchased it .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Each time , Apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I believe this MacBook Pro was a lemon right out the gate .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1

This computer is like ... I 'm lost for words .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This is the best switch I have ever done .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This has much more memory and ram memory .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Even the battery life is like WOW !	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I love , LOVE , LOOOOVE !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It contains a long battery life , incredible specs , and an overall enjoyable performance .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Upgrading from a toshiba laptop , I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides .	OS#GENERAL#1
The snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos , as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy .	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
In upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product , hence the 5 star review .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Love this computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It has done everything and more that I expected .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I am sure it will be able to do all I need it to do in the future as well .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#1
So far I have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1

its been easy breezy since then .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
how could you not love a Mac	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
so far so good , i have not encountered any issues with this computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value .	LAPTOP#PRICE#0	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase , so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
To a prospective buyer , 08/10/2012 Once you go Mac , you 'll never go back .	COMPANY#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Was the best decision we ever made .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
We do n't have to de-frag , deliete cookies , run security programs , or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
You ca n't get a virus on Mac , so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security , and not having to replace your computer every year or two .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
Never had any issues , no frustrations just great easy wireless , all in one fun !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#1
It 's great .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
because it is a touch screen you do n't even need a mouse .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
You will probably never use it in tablet mode but it 's nice to know you have that option .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
If you draw on the other hand i 'm sure you will love using this in tablet mode .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Lastly , because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#1
This computer is great .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I have a 250 GB SSD and 10 GB of RAM in it , which I installed myself .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0

I am very satisfied with EVERYTHING about this machine .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

This MBP is clean , neat , and simple .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I like that .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It takes less time to power up , and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Very nice .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I am pleased with my decision , however I have only had this for a few weeks .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
There are a few things I am dissappointed with though .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Only 2 USB ports .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
No HDMI port .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
Not a big deal for me , but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
As a student majoring computer science , I really fell in love with this laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's 15.6 inches , which for me is not too big nor too small .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
It has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU , which makes this laptop blazing fast ( boots up in under 5 seconds , with the help of the SSD of course ) .	CPU#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	GRAPHICS#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
- It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS , games , documents , and anything in between .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
- It 's not touchscreen !	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
- Its keyboard is nicely arranged , silent , and back-lit which is nice , but what I do n't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#-1
- This laptop is so silent , its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load , thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power , thus less heat .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	FANS_COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
- It can run games really well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Well , not really well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#0
MOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#0
Medium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable ( 60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps # pcmasterrace ) .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#0
- It 's lightweight and easy to carry around .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1
- The screen is a matte 1080p display , which is nice , but with poor viewing angle .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I find myself adjusting it regularly .	DISPLAY#USABILITY#-1
- It looks sleek and gorgeous .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Blends in with any accessory you use with it .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
All in all I am very happy with this purchase .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
And with this price , I do n't think you can buy anything better .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
All I can say is I am impressed .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
It 's worth it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Pay me now , Pay me later ... ... ... I am happy with my choice going with this laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I was disappointed .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
It seemed like a great computer and a great deal .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1
The first one arrived and it did not work .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
The space bar sticks .	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I find it hard to navigate from screen to screen .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
For a non-computer savvy person , it was very disappointing .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I like the 13 inch macbooks .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
The new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad .	OS#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

This should be more than enough computer for almost everyone .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I would not hesitate recommending this to anyone .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It fast and easy to set up .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I had cloned my data from my old computer using Carbon Copy Cloner ( CCC ) and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized , lazy , and eye candy person in all of us .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
The MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
If you want to use the Internet , then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen , like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#1
This computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I would 've given 5 stars , had it not been for the hours of updates I 've had to do to this upon arrival .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Other than that , I love it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's portable , reliable , and great for what I use it for .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

It 's very sturdy .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1

This machine is flawless , fast , and classy .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I 'm not sure if it was covered in the description , but it does have a backlit keyboard and I 'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge ( Except I do n't use this for games or videos , which obviously would drain the battery faster ) .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1

My daughter 's MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago .	BATTERY#QUALITY#-1
It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I 'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $ 129 for a new battery , $ 39 to replace it and $ 139 for a new keyboard .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1	SUPPORT#PRICE#-1
I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal ' .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Apple does n't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The battery is simply considered 'consumable ' and NOT covered .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple does n't consider the product defective .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
His reply astonished me , looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said : 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear !	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
He did n't specify who are 'they ' but from the tone of his voice and his 6 ' 5 ' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Here is my take on all of this , the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China , hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school , call them geniuses , and bully everybody who complains about their product .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
Steve Jobs is dead , so is Apple .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
No more Apple devices in my household .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

I 've been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I can bat around all the things that everyone else says , but it 's been what we 've been using for decades and I have nothing bad to say .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It churns out HD content , runs without many flaws and I 've yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990 's .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1

That 's a pretty impressive track record do n't you think ?	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
However , the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
While the price may seem high , it is worth every penny with its many perks .	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The Pros : A Ton of Storage Space- This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB ( 1000GB ) hard drive .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
That is plenty of space for your laptop , which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
If you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop , this is the laptop you should consider .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies , without having the keyboard in the way of things .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I find it much easier to type on and much more durable .	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#1	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#1
Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10 % battery life .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The Cons : No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned , but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
However , I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
Overall , I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1
It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1

I 'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The computer it self is amazing .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It is an older model , so know that upfront , but it is everything I was looking for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#0	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
Also , if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
So long story short , if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I know people were complaining that it is n't the newest model , but it all depends on what you are looking for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#0
I highly recommend ! !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing , searching the internet , and keeping track of everyday life .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It 's also incredibly light , has a battery that can last for days , and looks like a piece of art .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Though , that 's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device .	LAPTOP#PRICE#0	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
When you look at the internal specs , the computer is only worth about $ 500 .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
It has a 128 GB storage capacity ( but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive ) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 , so do n't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	CPU#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
If your looking to be a trendy hipster who ca n't live without a Mac , it 's a great buy .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you do n't need .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

- With that being said , for the price ( $ 800 ! ) , you get a nice fast laptop , but if you ask me , it 's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included :	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
This laptop has no : - Touchscreen - Optical Drives ( OK , a bit of a stretch , because that would eat up precious space in this monster ) - Swivel or detachable screen	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

This is really nice , but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't.. may be the laptop , may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8 ?	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Either way , highly annoying .	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
I hooked up a USB mouse and all is well .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#1
All works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	OS#USABILITY#0
Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great , but a little bit of a learning curve there too , as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need ...	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	DISPLAY#USABILITY#0
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop ( the mouse was the only negative I could really see ) ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	MOUSE#GENERAL#-1
This is a fantastic transformer !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	DISPLAY#GENERAL#1
The only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program , it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#-1	DISPLAY#USABILITY#-1
I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1

I 've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer , it 's thin & amp ; light and The wireless keyboard works great .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I was impressed ; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
One thing I did't like is the stylus holder , it 's cheap plastic and does n't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port .	HARDWARE#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I do't use it , I think I would accidently break it and loose my stylus .	HARDWARE#QUALITY#-1
The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1

The only downside are the speakers .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#-1
They do n't go very loud at all .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#-1

Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1

I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing , so the entry-level 13 ' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Macs hardly ever get viruses , and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
Furthermore , Mac OS X Mountain Lion 's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans , which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed .	OS#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit , which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing ( Typing ? ) .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#1

SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
The glass track pad is large enough for Apple 's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers , zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers , accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers .

It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches , though you should n't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#1
The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software , though you can also download software online at your own risk .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#1
There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store ( and counting ... ) , and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store .	SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it 's simple to use User Interface .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#1	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#1

When the MacBook Pro arrived , I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac ... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
So I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0

I will never ever buy any apple product in my life .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

First , when I move the screen to put it in tablet position , the hinge does n't seem totally solid .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I feel like I need to be really gentle with it , but maybe that 's just me .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#0
Also , and this maybe is another personal quirk , but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#-1

2 . Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on , other times it is a few seconds	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
3 . Can not manually take battery out , unless you work for apple or have the tools	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1	BATTERY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students , and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

o Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for , for example engineering majors need extra applications & amp ; systems to do some work , but they are easily downloadable .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also , brilliant .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

Hard drives can be replaced , RAM can be added as needed , and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
This , added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money , detracts from the computer 's value .	HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase , but for the price , this is a four star ( good ) computer .	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

Now that they are not virus free ( [ ... ] l ) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower , more expensive , and do not last as long .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

My HP seemed great at first , then the problems started ... ..wireless adapter would just & quot ; disappear & quot ; and the system said it did n't have a network card .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#-1

HP was NO help .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The lettering wore off the keys , so you better be able to type blind .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#-1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#-1
The battery lasted 12 months , then pffft ... ..gone .	BATTERY#QUALITY#-1
When I had a boot up issue , the HP recovery did n't work .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
The disks I made would n't work ... ..HP support stated & quot ; we 're a hardware company , not a software company. & quot ;	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Then there was a power cord recall ... .HP never notified us ... ..and we did register ... ... never again .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
I do n't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support , search functions , or hold times ... ..dropped the HP and never looked back .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system .	OS#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice .	OS#USABILITY#1
I also like I have the option to push calendars , photos , and contacts to an iPad , iPod Touch , or iPhone ( if I had any of those ) .	OS#USABILITY#1
The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though & amp ; # 34 ; Home Sharing & amp ; # 34 ; ( I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer ) but I could not figure that out .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#-1
I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music ( losing my ratings ) .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#-1
I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1

I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'Show all bookmarks ' icon ( the open book icon at the upper left ) .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
Once in a long while that does n't work ; in that case I turn the computer off , then on again , and sign in -- problem solved .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#0
I 'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself , and just conclude by saying that I 'm delighted with my purchase .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
When I attach a mouse it 's fine but the touchpad is really annoying .	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
I went through the settings and there is n't a way to fix it .	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
