Then just the other day , my left `` mouse '' button snapped !	MOUSE#QUALITY#-1
Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Buyer Beware .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1

The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap ;	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( I bought the memory stick they recomended ) .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ?	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

This is definitely a computer worth the money ;	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#PRICE#1
The mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	MOUSE#USABILITY#0
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .	SUPPORT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1

His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
After they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .	SUPPORT#GENERAL#-1

Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#0

Additional caveat : the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .	SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES#0

It really is perfect for work and play .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#-1
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
lots of preloaded software .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0

I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1

The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#-1	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1

While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL#1	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .	OS#GENERAL#-1
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .	OS#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .	PORTS#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
I love windows 7 but i ca n't give Toshiba any credit for that , unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .	OS#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	SUPPORT#GENERAL#-1
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .	SHIPPING#QUALITY#1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba .	SHIPPING#QUALITY#-1
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .	SHIPPING#QUALITY#-1
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .	SHIPPING#QUALITY#-1
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .	OS#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1

It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#1
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty , able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
My one complaint with this laptop is that I 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .	PORTS#QUALITY#-1
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .	HARDWARE#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#0
Let me start with the good : So awesome .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .	OS#GENERAL#1	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
This one has had the same effect .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .	OS#GENERAL#1
The Unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy .	DISPLAY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1	DISPLAY#QUALITY#-1
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#0	DISPLAY#USABILITY#0
The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Enabling the battery timer is useless .	BATTERY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
The `` Time remaining '' goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .	BATTERY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .	BATTERY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot . : - )	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
If you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	CPU#MISCELLANEOUS#0	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1

This machine delivers .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
It is a bit heavy .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#-1
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
This is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#-1
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
It also does not have bluetooth .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .	OS#USABILITY#1
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1

great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

Mac is not made for gaming .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1

Was not happy with one of the programs on it .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .	SOFTWARE#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Also , the extended warranty was a problem .	WARRANTY#GENERAL#-1
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .	WARRANTY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1	DISPLAY#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .	COMPANY#GENERAL#0
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
It freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Another issue I have with it is the battery .	BATTERY#GENERAL#-1
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : `` Consider replacing your battery '' and it does not hold full charge .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	BATTERY#QUALITY#-1

But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
I think this computer is super lame .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
It doesnt work worth a damn .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
The display is beyond horrible .	DISPLAY#GENERAL#-1
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .	DISPLAY#USABILITY#-1

I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
In those three years , I 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#1
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1	WARRANTY#GENERAL#1

First the screen goes completely out .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1

HP is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1	WARRANTY#PRICE#-1
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .	SHIPPING#PRICE#-1
I ' v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .	SHIPPING#PRICE#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1

Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .	KEYBOARD#GENERAL#1	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#1
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .	OS#GENERAL#0

When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
For me , five stars is not enough .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I love the 15 '' MacBook Pro .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i 'm totally ( almost kind of maybe definitely ) obsessed with it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It was very easy to just pick up and use --	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS .	OS#USABILITY#1

There are several programs for school or office use ( Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc . ) , music ( Garageband ) , photo management ( Photo Booth , iPhoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( iMovie ) , etc .	SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES#0

I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#0	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .	MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY#-1	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1

My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#1
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .	SUPPORT#GENERAL#1
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .	COMPANY#GENERAL#1

I run Dreamweaver , Final Cut Pro 7 , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought .	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
My MacBook Pro is no exception .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .	MOUSE#USABILITY#1	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	MOUSE#USABILITY#1

it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

I really wish I had done this years ago .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#1
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I had to call Apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
Steve Jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
The lesson learned here is : It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .	HARD_DISC#QUALITY#-1
So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#1
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#0
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .	SHIPPING#QUALITY#-1
My laptop cost approximately $ 2,300 and DIED after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1
Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
I bought it from HSN because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often ... ..	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#1	SHIPPING#QUALITY#-1
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
They went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#0
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
The perfect notebook ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid ( I have tried both Motorola and HTC ) plugged into the USB port .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#-1
Called tech support and got the usual Acer `` We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you '' I explained there was no software involved in booting .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it `` could be a problem with the bios '' How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#-1
With today 's company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Summary : I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1	POWER_SUPPLY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE ! ! !	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I 'm tired of the inept service .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! !	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .	POWER_SUPPLY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	POWER_SUPPLY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook for all your needs !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's great and we will always stick with Apple computers , we have been so happy with them .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
The 13 '' MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .	OS#USABILITY#1	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	MOUSE#USABILITY#1
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#-1	HARD_DISC#QUALITY#-1
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#-1
So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
It is held in place magnetically .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY#-1
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1
10 hours of battery life is really something else ... .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I highly recommend that you buy this product .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES ( like a PC , maybe worse ) and I loose all my open documents !	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I Hate it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
It is the easiest computer I have ever used	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I LOVE IT !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I ca n't say enough good for it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's A MAC ! !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15 '' Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
It 's face and depanable .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art ... ..	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
it 's just a great toy to have around .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
very very slow laptop .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
tons of bloatware and junk programs .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1
ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
Amazing machine .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It is a big big , but since it has a 18.4 '' screen what would you expect !	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
It is truly a Desktop Replacement .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Very fast and efficient !	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !	MOUSE#USABILITY#1
Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#-1
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I also got the added bonus of a 30 '' HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I never have had a good result with this computer .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .	HARD_DISC#QUALITY#-1	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that is n't good at all .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1
The right speaker did not work .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#-1	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#-1	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .	MOUSE#GENERAL#-1
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
the mouse buttons are hard to push .	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
i cant believe HP put this out .	COMPANY#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
do not buy you will be disappointed .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
i 'm returning mine	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
dell is a decently made pc .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#0
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I love HP , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .	COMPANY#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
This is perfect for her field .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
At first when I got this product , I loved it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY#-1
So I called Compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which I should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
2 months later , the battery went .	BATTERY#QUALITY#-1
They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .	POWER_SUPPLY#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Not worth it one bit .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1	SUPPORT#QUALITY#-1
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#1
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
And it is impossible to get them back in .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Strengths : Well-shaped	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
Weaknesses : A bad videocard !	GRAPHICS#GENERAL#-1
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
It was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
I was said it 's videocard .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL#-1
Very disappointed !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Did n't expect to repair it at once !	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Do n't buy this model .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ( ! ) .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#PRICE#-1
The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	PORTS#QUALITY#-1	PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Keyboard could use some trimming .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?	KEYBOARD#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I 'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The benefits were immediate !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Awesome graphics !	GRAPHICS#GENERAL#1
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !	POWER_SUPPLY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
