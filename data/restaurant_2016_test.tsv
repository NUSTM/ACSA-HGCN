Nothing really came across as outstanding .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Very disappointed .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#1
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20+ per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1

NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
– It is sad to see a place that was once `` THE '' place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch , now be the place that is a big `` DONT BOTHER . ''	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS `` DINERS , DRIVE-INS , AND DIVES '' hosted by Guy Fieri , in which Schooner or Later was subject of .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Perhaps now , Scooner or Later falls into the `` Dive '' category .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1

When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We left without ever getting service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

Great Pizza , Poor Service	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
– Love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Also love their caeser salad .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
She does n't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
But she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Great Breakfast	FOOD#QUALITY#1

First off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
not chewy at all .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
melt in your mouth .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Chintzy portions	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
– The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ) .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1
We easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
I 'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Terrible service , food ok , pricey	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#0	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
None that I can think of .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Oh I forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and I guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
In other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .	FOOD#QUALITY#0	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#0
If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park .	LOCATION#GENERAL#1
Its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .	LOCATION#GENERAL#1
Parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
Always good .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1

Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

Very poor customer service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
– Schooner or Later 's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .	LOCATION#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#0	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
As part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
When we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager continually interrupted with `` Is there anything else I can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
In short , Schooner or Later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

I picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
It ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .	FOOD#QUALITY#0
Though , one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ? MSG ? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#0	SERVICE#GENERAL#1

The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .	FOOD#PRICES#-1
