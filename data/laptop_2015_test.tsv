Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

My only concern is that since the battery is not external , I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time .	BATTERY#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1

So to communicate I need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built-in mike .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
That 's a nuisance for family Skype calls ... only one can speak at a time .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#-1
We have n't used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars , but so far it has been a very good laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1

One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard , which is larger than usual .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1

My final thoughts : if you are a Mac user , stay away .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
If you want to travel with this laptop , do n't buy it .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#-1

For $ 250 , which is as much as my graphics card alone cost , this laptop is an incredible value .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It is quite impressive at multitasking , which really surprised me .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen , it 's certainly good enough for the average person , but if you 're used to good screens this may bother you a bit , but it 's certainly not unbearable by anyone 's standards .	DISPLAY#GENERAL#0
If you want to game , this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings , but I certainly would n't recommend it for gaming .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Overall , a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Would definitely recommend for those who are `` technologically ignorant ''	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1

Would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
It was not responsive at all to touch .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
And while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work , your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
If they can fix this , I think it would be a very nice , cost-effective laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#PRICE#1

I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available , but nothing has helped .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Also , the touchpad is almost 'sticky ' , which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1

But the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing , my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it 's really annoying .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1
I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad , i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1	MOUSE#USABILITY#-1

Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop , do n't buy this .	MOUSE#GENERAL#-1
The touchpad has n't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning , I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I 've worked with have some inherent oddities .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MOUSE#QUALITY#-1

Firstly , it has no leds to let you know what is going on , no cap lock , no hard drive indicator , nothing .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
Ok , one light to let you know if the damn thing is on .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#-1
The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it , even when the strength bar is filled .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY#-1
Also , when you try to download a large file , like a video , it will start out normally , downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec , making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless .

Retina screen , solid build quality , weight , fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand .	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	COMPANY#GENERAL#1
Cons : Honestly zero con 's ... as a Windows PC user the switch over was seamlessly , I run Parallel when I need Windows .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
All my devices work flawlessly .	LAPTOP#USABILITY#1
I 'm an amature , so this does more than I can handle .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
I 'm perfectly satisfied , just have to get use to the new 6.1 system I ca n't see a problem .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1	OS#USABILITY#0
I ' doi9ng fine now , and happy as a bug .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The price is great and it does everything I want to do , Thanks .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's perfect !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
It 's great for what he uses it for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
I am really not happy with this computer ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
I do n't like WINDOWS 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar .	OS#GENERAL#-1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#-1
Would not buy it again .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
Meh ... but cheap .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#0	LAPTOP#PRICE#1
The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY#1	DISPLAY#QUALITY#1
Now the graphics are not HD ... and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic ( medium low grade ) plastic .	GRAPHICS#QUALITY#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
So if you do n't have kids , or not in high school or do n't accidently sit on it , it should be fine .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
Now the speed is disappointing .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Start up is fine maybe 20 secs at most , but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1
Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#0
All in all I wish I had waited a bit .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1
This laptop is amazing !	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Windows 8.1 has its pros and cons .	OS#GENERAL#0
The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	KEYBOARD#USABILITY#0
I was nervous at first that I purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Of course this will decrease your battery life .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#0
The sound is very nice and crisp .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY#1
Also , I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
I 'm still exploring the various features but overall I am satisfied with my purchase .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#0	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
The HP Envy 15 has been everything I expected .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
After doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for , This one hit all the criteria I had .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1
The laptop is very responsice with the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	SOFTWARE#QUALITY#1
I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
used 6 times black screen returned for refund	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#GENERAL#-1	LAPTOP#QUALITY#-1
do not use the facial recognition	SOFTWARE#GENERAL#-1
Windows 8 is not supported by a lot of things !	OS#USABILITY#-1
The Dell is quick enough , sturdy , not good with finger prints .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#1
It does what it advertises .	LAPTOP#GENERAL#1
Price is great , wish it did n't have Windows 8 , but that is an opinion .	LAPTOP#PRICE#1	OS#GENERAL#-1
I would recommend it , for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop .	LAPTOP#QUALITY#1
I bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework , it 's not a `` fast '' computer , but it 's great for what she needs it for and very light weight !	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE#-1	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES#1	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS#1
Love the price too !	LAPTOP#PRICE#1
