First of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#0	DRINKS#PRICES#-1
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .	DRINKS#QUALITY#-1	DRINKS#PRICES#-1
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
