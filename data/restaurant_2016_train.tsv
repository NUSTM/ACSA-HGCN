First of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#0	DRINKS#PRICES#-1
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .	DRINKS#QUALITY#-1	DRINKS#PRICES#-1
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1

Maggot in the food !	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#0
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1

The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .

Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

None was made so i hung up .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

Everything was going good until we got our meals .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The level of rudeness was preposterous .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	DRINKS#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
This place ... god where do i begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#0	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Great Hot Dogs !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .	FOOD#PRICES#-1
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to '' that night - WTF ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Maitre-D- '' Eat and get out ''	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .	DRINKS#QUALITY#1
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
A word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
If you go here , do it on his off-night .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Best meal in a long time !	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
The food is great and the environment is even better .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
Everyone must come here at least once .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Highly recommend it !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level	FOOD#QUALITY#1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#1
Great Atmosphere	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
Poor service and management	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Don ’ t go to this place !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Appetizers took nearly an hour .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
What a hassle !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The food is very good , but not outstanding .	FOOD#QUALITY#0
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Expensive	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
So rude ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can I help you '' and `` how many are in your party . ''	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
bad staff	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I generally like this place .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
The food is good .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The design of the space is good .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
But the service is HORRID !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
