This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1

What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !

There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .	DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1

Great Indian food	FOOD#QUALITY#1

Very `` normal Indian food '' , but done really well .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#0	FOOD#QUALITY#1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1

Wretched and retching	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
None was made so i hung up .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Polite acknowledgement is out ;	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#1

I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .	FOOD#QUALITY#1

I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .

I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1

The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
