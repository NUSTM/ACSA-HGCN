One of my favorite places in Brooklyn .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Overpriced and not tasty	FOOD#PRICES#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1

I was n't here for the pizza so I ca n't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I 'll be back for sure .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
awesome	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
If you do n't like it , I do n't know what to tell you .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
I 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
SO GOOD	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .	DRINKS#QUALITY#-1
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1

For a Fabulous Wedding !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#1
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
would NOT go back .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The high prices you 're going to pay is for the view not for the food .	LOCATION#GENERAL#0	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
$ 170 down the toilet ...	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Good Experience	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#0	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0

BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Food took some time to prepare , all worth waiting for .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
Great find in the West Village !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Unhygienic	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I do not recommend .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Awesome	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !	RESTAURANT#PRICES#1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1

Very pleased	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Still we keep going back : )	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I will NEVER return .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Best In ALL of NYC	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
you should travel from the Bronx to try it ...	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1

In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
great taste	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Great , original taste .	FOOD#QUALITY#1
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#PRICES#1
Also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0
AMAZING MY FAVORITE ! ! !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n't make you by bottles .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
Which lets face it ... .at times it 's a good thing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME ! ! !	RESTAURANT#PRICES#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Highly recommended !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
One of the best , if not THE best , restaurants in Park Slope ( and NY in general )	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .	FOOD#PRICES#-1
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#0	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Just not good at all .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#0	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0
Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Our experience did not ever get any better .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We asked for beverages and never received them .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I wish I COULD be refunded !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
She replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ''	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .	SERVICE#GENERAL#0
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Probably would not go back here .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
One of the BEST	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Wretched and retching	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
None was made so i hung up .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Eat at your own risk .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
More Williamsburg Garbage	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
She just nodded and walked off .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We were charged full price .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Lives up to the hype	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#0
It was well worth the wait .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
It ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
Terrible would be a compliment !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Stay away	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I love it .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Loved it	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Dumbfoundingly Poor	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Polite acknowledgement is out ;	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
supercilious scorn is in .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
Everything was going good until we got our meals .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The level of rudeness was preposterous .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#0	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#PRICES#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to '' that night - WTF ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
If you go here , do it on his off-night .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Everyone must come here at least once .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Highly recommend it !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Appetizers took nearly an hour .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
What a hassle !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	FOOD#QUALITY#-1
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Expensive	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1
So rude ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
